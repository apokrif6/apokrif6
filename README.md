<b>Unreal Engine/C++ Programmer 🎮</b>

I’m a C++ Game Programmer with 6+ years of professional experience.

I have strong expertise and in-depth knowledge of Unreal Engine, including the Gameplay Ability System, AI, animation systems, and engine-level development. Strong focus on tools programming – from extending editor functionality with Editor Utility Widgets to building workflow automation with Python.
